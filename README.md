My name is Toyosi (toe-yor-cee), and I am a frontend developer interested in creating frontend applications that are beautiful, scalable and efficient. 

I love music, gaming and figuring out how things work on the internet. 
<br/>

I also write tech articles about my interests, which highlight my experiences with frontend technologies, blockchain ecosystems and smart contracts because I love <a href="https://reine.hashnode.dev/what-is-web3-an-introduction-to-the-decentralized-web">web3</a>.

I am a published author on KnowTechie. You can check out my articles on their <a href="https://knowtechie.com/author/reine-dev/"> website.</a> 

I am currently on the path to becoming a blockchain software engineer (smart contracts).
